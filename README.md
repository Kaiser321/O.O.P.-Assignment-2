# How to Play
	- Move mouse cursor left and right to move the spaceship
	- Use mouse click to shoot and hold it down to go full automatic 
	- Use keys 1, 2, 3, and 4 to change the bullet types and each bullet type is color coded 
	- 1 fires Red bullets, 2 is Green bullet, 3 arms Blue bullets and 4 is for Purple bullets
	- There are 4 different types of enemies each color coded the same as the bullets
	- To do damage to the enemies you must shoot them with the bullet that matches it's color, or else they take no damage 
	- Make sure to try to collect the coins the enemy drops after they explode. Save up to buy upgrades later for the ship to make it more powerful
	- Gold coins is worth 1 and blue diamond is worth 10
	- As a game round goes on the monsters will drop faster and more frequent
	- All money earned and upgrades bought will be saved so you can continue where you left off the next time you play the game
	- Bullets starts with 25 damage. Each upgrade increases it by 25 and max out on 100 (if you max it out its 1 shot kill)
	- Upgrading bullet speed makes your bullet travel fast and Rate of fire makes your weapon shoot faster. There are 4 levels to upgrade for both of them
